# FIXES against original 1.5.6 version
 - Fixed excessive expression spam
 - Fixed Log call hook

# ModernCamera
Makes the camera more like an action MMO camera. This includes better control over the third person camera and a first person mode. Action mode allows you to toggle camera rotation so you don't have to always hold down the mouse to rotate the camera.

### Configuration
All configuration is done with the in game options menu


### Known Issues
- Can see through floors/roofs from below (this cannot be fixed because objects are missing mesh faces)
- Shadows flicker when looking directly horizontal (Due to fake cloud shadows)


### FAQ
**Q: Why is my characters name and healthbar always shown at top of screen?**

**A:** Because the mouse is locked over the character. Use an over-the-shoulder offset in options to move the mouse off-center so that the mouse is not over the character.

**Q: Why can I see objects popping (loading) in and out in the distance now?**

**A:** This is done for performance by the game. Normally you don't see this because you are looking down at your character. ModernCamera cannot change this.

**Q: Why can't I rotate the camera after hiding the UI?**

**A:** You may have pressed "Enter" which causes the game to lock the camera because the chatbox should normally be open. To fix this, toggle the UI back on, click in the chat box, and press "Enter" again.
